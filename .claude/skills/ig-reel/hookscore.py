"""
hookscore.py - score the first line of a Reel on the five things strong hooks
have in common, and rank a batch of them against each other.

What this is:  five local heuristics, computed on your machine from the text
alone. They measure properties that hooks which hold attention tend to share -
a length you can say in under three seconds, a concrete marker, something at stake,
the payload at the front rather than the back, and a viewer to aim it at.

What this is NOT:  a view predictor. It was tested against 74 real short-form
hooks, transcribed from the first three seconds of the top eight and bottom
eight performers on five channels. Separating a real hook from a deliberately
bad one it does well: AUC 0.83, and 9 of 10 written-to-be-bad hooks scored
below the real median. Separating a good creator's hits from that same
creator's misses it barely does at all: AUC 0.56, where 0.50 is a coin flip.

So use it for what it measured well. It catches greetings, preambles, hooks
with nothing concrete in them and hooks that take five seconds to say. It will
not tell you which of two decent hooks will travel, and nothing that reads text
can, because that is decided by your face, your edit, your audio and who
Instagram shows it to. Trust the retention graph over this script.

Each check returns 0 to 100. Higher is better.
